# Evidence Analysis Project

## Overview
The Evidence Analysis Project aims to leverage AI to analyze and populate an Obsidian vault with thousands of pieces of evidence. The project involves processing various media formats, including videos, images, PDFs, and text documents, to extract insights and create structured notes for better understanding and management of evidence trails.

This is a personal project for my personal use but I might as well make it publicly available.

Listed features and stack are a combination of wants and wishes and is far from final.
